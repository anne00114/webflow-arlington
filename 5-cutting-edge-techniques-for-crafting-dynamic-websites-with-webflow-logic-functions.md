## Technique #1: Dynamic Content Display Based on User Input

One of the most common requirements when building dynamic websites is to conditionally display specific content based on user input. For instance, we worked with a client in the real estate industry to create a contact form that would appear only after users had successfully filtered properties.

### Demo: A Form with Logic to Toggle Content Displays

The form is designed for property searches by city. After entering "Arlington, TX" and clicking "Search":

```html
<form id="search">
  <input id="city" />
  <button>Search</button>
</form>

<div id="results">
  <!-- Matching properties go here -->
</div> 

<div id="contact">
  <!-- Contact form should be displayed here -->
</div>
```

By default, the "contact" section remains hidden. However, after a successful search, it smoothly slides into view.

### The Code: Functions and Conditionals

To achieve this dynamic behavior, we attached a submit handler function to the form:

```js
function handleSearch() {

  // Retrieve the search value
  let city = document.getElementById("city").value;  

  // Check if it matches "Arlington, TX"
  if (city === "Arlington, TX") {

    // Display the contact form
    document.getElementById("contact").classList.add("visible");

  } else {

    // Hide the contact form
    document.getElementById("contact").classList.remove("visible");

  }

}

document.getElementById("search").addEventListener("submit", handleSearch);
```

This function employs conditionals to selectively add or remove the "visible" class, which has the CSS transition effect. This simple example demonstrates logic-driven conditional content display.

## Technique #2: Dynamic Form Field Generation

In many cases, it's necessary to add or remove fields in a form dynamically based on specific conditions. For a nonprofit client, we created a donation "builder" that allowed users to customize gift designations.

### Demo: A Builder Form that Adds/Removes Fields Dynamically

The initial form includes basic donation fields:

```html
<form id="donation">

  <!-- Name, amount, and more -->

  <div id="designations">

  </div>

  <button id="add">Add Designation</button>

</form>  
```

When users click "Add," a new fieldset is dynamically inserted using JavaScript:

```html
<fieldset>
  <input name="designation">
  <button class="remove">Remove</button>  
</fieldset>
```

Users can continue to add or remove fieldsets as needed.

### DOM Manipulation with Logic 

To make this dynamic form field addition work, we attached a click handler to the "Add" button:

```js
const addButton = document.getElementById("add");

addButton.addEventListener("click", () => {

  // Create a new fieldset element
  const fieldset = document.createElement("fieldset");

  // Add input fields, buttons, and more

  // Insert it into the DOM  
  document.getElementById("designations").append(fieldset);

  // Attach a handler for removal
  fieldset.querySelector(".remove").addEventListener("click", removeFieldset);

});
``` 

We generate HTML elements dynamically and insert them into the page. The removal process follows a similar pattern, selectively deleting elements by their IDs. This approach allows for fully customizable form structures through code. Additionally, the implementation includes validation and data sanitization to ensure high-quality user data.

## Technique #3: Personalized Content Generation

For a publishing client, we aimed to create a welcoming experience for authors by addressing them by name and including a personalized biography on their profile pages. This required the use of logic to access custom content values.

### Demo: Logic for Customized Text from User Data

The author profile HTML includes designated areas for personalized content:

```html
<div class "author">

  <p class "greeting"></p>

  <div class "bio"></div>

</div>
```

When a profile page is loaded, the respective values are retrieved and inserted:

```js
// Obtain the author data object
const author = Authors.find(a => a.id == currentId);

// Insert dynamic text
document.querySelector('.greeting').innerText = `Hello ${author.name}!`;
document.querySelector('.bio').innerText = author.bio; 
```

This approach delivers a tailored

 experience for each individual author.

### Accessing Data Stores and Parameters

Webflow enables the definition of content models and variables to store dynamic data. We established an "Authors" collection with fields for names and biographies. During the page load, JavaScript accesses the relevant author object using the "currentId" parameter value:

```js
fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/authors/' + currentId)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(author => {

    // Insert personalized content

  });
```

By retrieving and inserting custom fields, this technique goes beyond simple tags, dynamically generating personalized text blocks.

## Technique #4: Real-Time Data Updates with Webflow API

For a recipe website, we aimed to enable ratings to update in real-time as users cast their votes. We harnessed Webflow's logic functions in conjunction with third-party APIs to create a real-time user experience.

### Demo: Synchronizing External Data with API Calls

Each recipe page displayed a rating out of 5 stars. The live rating data was stored externally, specifically in Airtable:

```
id: 123 
rating: 3
```

Upon loading a page, JavaScript initiated an API call:

```js
fetch('https://api.airtable.com/v0/appRZn9...')
  .then(res => res.json()) 
  .then(data => {

    // Update the rating 
  });
```

Votes submitted by other users were instantly reflected.

### Request Handling, Response Processing, and Error Management 

The fetch API method performs asynchronous GET requests, with response handling as follows:

```js 
.then(data => {

  // Loop through the rows  
  data.forEach(record => {

    // Retrieve the corresponding rating    
    let rating = record.get('rating');

    // Update the HTML
    document.querySelector(`#rating-${id}`).textContent = rating;

  });

})
.catch(err => {

  console.error('Error:', err);

});
```

Errors are gracefully managed and logged. 

Enhancing static websites by incorporating live, synchronized external data results in compelling user experiences. This technique showcases the potential of combining Webflow's logic functions with external web resources.

## Technique #5: Complex Animations

For an educational site, we aimed to create introductory animations that elegantly unveiled different course sections. Precise timing control, managed through JavaScript code, allowed us to create sophisticated visual sequences.

### Demo: Multi-Step Animation with Callbacks and Conditionals

At the start, course cards are hidden with a CSS opacity of 0. JavaScript triggers each step of the animation:

```js
function step1() {

  // Fade in the first 3 cards

  setTimeout(step2, 1000);

}

function step2() {

  // Slide in the remaining cards

  if (cardsShown == 6) {

    finishAnimation(); 

  }

} 
```

CSS classes are applied to stagger the appearance of the cards over a 2-second duration.

### Timing Control, CSS Adjustments, and Performance 

Each step function modifies the styles of the elements:

```js
function fadeIn(el) {

  el.classList.add('fade');

  // Apply a CSS transition for fading

}

function slideIn(el) {

  el.classList.add('slide');

  // Apply a CSS transition for sliding

}
```

Precise setTimeout delays coordinate the sequence of the animation. By exclusively manipulating the className properties, we achieve better performance compared to making direct style changes. Breaking down the steps into smaller callback functions provides finer control over the sequence of the animation. This asynchronous approach distributes the animation work, preventing it from locking up the thread. As a result, you can create complex and polished interactions through low-level JavaScript control.
